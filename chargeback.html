                Local regulations and the international dispute resolution guidelines of Visa and/or Mastercard both provide protection to customers who use credit cards or debit cards to make purchases. Additionally, Treating Clients Fairly (TCF) standards are in place at many financial institutions worldwide to safeguard customers from malevolent or dishonest online retailers.

                    The majority of cardholders are already aware of their financial institution’s ability to help them contest an unlawful or unapproved transaction. These disagreements are known as “fraud” disputes. You can ask your bank to stop the charges, for instance, if your card was lost or stolen and you noticed a strange transaction on your account. In order to safeguard you against fraud, Visa and Mastercard mandate that your bank takes that action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are protected even if you voluntarily make a purchase in the event that the ordered item is not delivered or you obtain something different from what was agreed upon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Few customers are aware, though, that you can also dispute transactions for goods or services you actually agreed to buy. There is a dispute known as a “Goods or Services” dispute as a result of these authorized transactions.

                    Given that they are often the outcome of a transaction that took place on a retailer’s website, conflicts involving goods or services are frequently complicated in nature. Customers have the option to reverse transactions if nothing was delivered, something was damaged, or even if the purchases were made as a result of deceptive advertising.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, issuing banks frequently show reluctance to resolve a claim in the client’s favor. When a customer requests a chargeback even though they intend to keep the item, this is known as “friendly fraud,” and it is carefully avoided. In order to fight friendly fraud, Visa and Mastercard have each modified the requirements for such claims numerous times over the past few years.

                    Anyone who has had charges on their credit card reversed has some knowledge of the chargeback procedure. Users of cryptocurrencies might ask if they can access the same fund recovery procedure. Can you get a chargeback for bitcoin?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both “Yes” and “No” are the responses. On the blockchain, transactions cannot be reversed in the same way that a credit card chargeback can. A persistent block is produced by each blockchain transaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By way of analogy, a crypto chargeback is possible. The actual transaction cannot be undone, but authorities and cryptocurrency exchanges can order scammers to reimburse their victims for their losses. These crypto recovery situations are frequently successful.

                    How is a bitcoin chargeback obtained by a victim of a cryptocurrency scam? Compared to chargebacks on credit cards, the procedure is more complicated. Banks and credit cards must comply with a process and give transparency in dispute resolution because they are governed by government legislation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The blockchain, on the other hand, can sometimes resemble the Wild, Wild West without a sheriff because the majority of cryptocurrency businesses aren’t regulated, at least not yet. As a result, victims of bitcoin scams require professionals to conduct a thorough investigation, write a report to submit to the relevant authorities, and act as an advocate for clients as they travel the path to cryptocurrency recovery.

                    Fixby Legal Recovery will first assess your situation to make sure it satisfies the requirements for submitting a chargeback request. Since you authorized the purchase, these requirements are much higher than those for a fraud-based chargeback. After our team has approved your claim, we will work with you to gather all of the proof and supporting documents your bank will require to process your claim. From the beginning of the procedure, until the bank makes a decision, we will be by your side. We offer the support, expertise, and information needed for this intricate process. Although you have rights as a customer, the merchant will also fight for them. To help them with chargeback claims, merchants also partner with reputable businesses. Isn’t it time that everyone had access to the same degree of knowledge?
                </p>
